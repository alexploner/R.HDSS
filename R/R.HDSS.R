#' Process HDSS demographic data from the INDEPTH project
#'
#' The INDEPTH project collects data in numerous health and demographic
#' surveillance system (HDSS) field sites in Africa, Asia and Oceania. This
#' package provides methods for processing the data files distributed through
#' the INDEPTH website.
#'
#' Note that while this package has been written to facilitate an existing
#' collaboration within the INDEPTH project, it should not be considered part of
#' INDEPTH. It is an independent effort to make available tools for processing
#' and analysing the data distributed through the project.
